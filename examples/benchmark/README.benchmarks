load0: write N tuples to M tables, does not use aggregates (M = number of passes each w/ different size)
load1: write N tuples to M tables, use aggregates
load2: write N tuples to one table, adds column for benchmark phase (fewer rules, higher level than load1)
count: write N tuples to one table table only remembers one tuple per phase


(Look at count.olg for comments; the others are very similar to it)
