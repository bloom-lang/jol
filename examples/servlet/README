Support files for the lincoln.war web service stuff.

===========================================================================

New automatic installation / configuration:

The following makefiles will automatically download and configure tomcat 
for you.

------------------------------

make deploy

downloads, installs and starts a tomcat web server, compiles jol, and 
sets up some sample lincoln servlets.  Running it again rebuilds jol, 
then reconfigures the servlets and restarts tomcat.  You can play with 
some example programs at:

  http://localhost:8080/lincoln/

(the wiki won't work without stasis...)

The tomcat server will be installed to jol/apache-tomcat-6.0.18/

------------------------------

STASIS_DIR=/path/to/stasis/ JAVA_DIR=/path/to/jdk/ make deploy-stasis

  The same, but configures tomcat and lincoln to use the Stasis JNI 
  bindings.  This doesn't work on macos yet.

------------------------------

make shutdown

  Shutdown tomcat.

------------------------------

make clean

  Delete tomcat and its logs.  Stasis databases will not be affected.

------------------------------

rm storefile.txt logfile.txt

  Delete the stasis database.

------------------------------

- Web server logs (overlog compilation errors go to them) live at:

   jol/apache-tomcat-6.0.18/logs/catalina.out

- Don't touch the contents of 

   jol/apache-tomcat-6.0.18/webapps

as 'make deploy' automatically blows it away.

===========================================================================

Manual installation / configuration:

Compiling linoln.war:

cd $JOL
ant war

Running lincoln.war:

Download the newest 'core' version of tomcat 6.x from tomcat.apache.org.

mkdir ~/local
cd ~/local
tar -zxf /path/to/apache-tomcat-*.tar.gz
cd apache-tomcat-*
mv webapps/ webapps-examples
mkdir webapps
cp $JOL/ant-dist/lincoln.war webapps/
bin/startup.sh

Browse to: http://localhost:8080/lincoln/ 

Note that tomcat will accept connections from the internet on
the following ports:

8009
8005
8080  <-- http port

Mess with $TOMCAT/conf/server.xml if you want to change this.

Jol can open ports too:

8747  <-- Civil.java opens this as of this writing.

Mess with $JOL/examples/servlet/web.xml, re-run 'ant war' and deploy the new
lincoln.war to change this.

Re-running (aka: 'deploying') linclon.war:

cd ~/local/apache-tomcat-*
bin/shutdown.sh
rm -rf webapps/lincoln
cp $JOL/ant-dist/lincoln.war webapps/
bin/startup.sh

Adding your own servlet:

1) Use the boilerplate code in Civil.java as a starting point for your Servlet
   class.

2) Copy the Civil section of the web.xml in the same directory as this file,
   and edit it as needed.

Getting Tomcat to load Stasis:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/sears/stasis4/build/src/stasis/:/home/sears/stasis4/build/src/libdfa/
export CATALINA_OPTS=-Djava.library.path=/home/sears/workspace/jol/bin/stasis/jni

(Update the paths so they don't hardcode my home directory...)
